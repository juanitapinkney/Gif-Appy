# giphyappy 

 The idea of creating my giphy webpage was very exciting and I had high hopes of delivering a great and functional giphy webpage, on time. Apparently, my understanding of the use of ajax/json is not at a level as I anticipated. 

 My purpose and plan in completing this homework assignment was/is to have Giphy/API  images and data displayed upon my page, along with an additional button to be displayed, in which would be prompted by the userâ€™s search. In once instance, I, for certain, had the additional button displayed on the page; however, that working code has mysteriously disappeared from my html and js files.

 Looking at my js file, I'm certain that my code and placement of code is, indeed, correct, including the closures and search parameters. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful at pushing the API/Giphy data and images to the call. 

 I will desperately, continue to debug and find a solution.

 Thank you for your consideration.
